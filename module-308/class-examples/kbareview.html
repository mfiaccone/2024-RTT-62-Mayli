        // 2 ways of registering an event listener
        // first is using the onclick="functionToRun()" on a html tag like we did in buttonclick.html
        // second using the addEventListner method built into the javascript language, this method is available on all HTML elements
        // to use the addEventListner function first you have to query the element from the document
        // then you can use the addEventLister('click', functionToRun());

        // ** If you want to spend some time reading about and experimenting with splice() and slice()
        // I have never in 20 years used either of these things
        // TRUE - Array.splice() changes the original array whereas Array.slice() does not.

        // 308.4 slide #28 talks about createing new HTML elements
        // there are 2 ways of creating elements
        // document.createElement('p');  this will create a new p tag in the document - can make all tags
        // createTextNode()  // this only works for text nodes like a p tag

        // Javascript tivia about numbers that is on the KBA
        // number datatype in javascript is either an integer or a float

        // ---------------------- forEach loop ---------------
        // note that I put an extra comma after the 5 to make a 6th element in the array that is actually empty 
        // the forEach method is called for each element in the array similar to a Java forEach but has differences
        // the nice part of this forEach is that you get the actual value, the index or pos, and the array itself
        // for each iteration of the loop
        // index    0 1 2 3 4 5
        let arr = [ 1,2,3,4,5, ];
        arr.forEach( function(value, index, array) {
            console.log("value = " + value);
            console.log("index = " + index);
        });

        //(Empty string) “”, 0, false, null, undefined, and NaN are Falsy Values
        // in the filter function using only a single variable in the function we are just getting the value in a variable called x
        // the filter function is returning true or false, if it returns true then it will keep the element
        // if it returnsn false it will remove the element 
        // however!!!!! 0 is another way of repressing false
        // SOOOOOO when x % 5 == 0 it is essentially returning false 
        console.log(arr.filter( function(x) {
            // when this evaluates to 0 it causes javascript to consider it false which then 
            // it does not alter the original array, it creates a new array and removes anything that evaluates to false 
            return x % 5;
        }));
